HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the
Structure of Pages

* html have an open and close tag 
* Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.
* Attributes Tell Us
More About Elements

## Summary


* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.


## Extra Markup

### DOCTYPE

Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using (although
browsers usually display the
page even if it is not included)


## Comments in HTML

comment help us to write anything without do anything in our page it is not a code just a tools we can use to define our page 

## ID Attribute 

we can use id to give our elemnt an id and then we can do a lots of things with our code 
we can change  **color** , **font** , **width** , **height** , **size** 
font-family and a lot of things 


## HTML5 Layout
 
 ![html layout ](https://www.programmersought.com/images/525/70d99d19a607dc68502fdc08dce7b555.png)

 
 For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

## Headers & Footers
 

 The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page.
In this example, the <header>
element used to contain the site
name and the main navigation.
The <footer> element contains
copyright information, along
with links to the privacy policy
and terms and conditions.
Each individual <article> and
<section> element can also
have its own <header> and
<footer> elements to hold the
header or footer information for
that section within the page.
For example, on a page with
several blog posts, each
individual post can be thought
of as a separate section. The
<header> element can therefore
be used to contain the title and
date of each individual post, and
the <footer> might contain
links to share the article on
social networking sites.
Please note that all of the
code shown in this chapter
is referenced in one HTML
document which is called:
html5-layout.html
